# Student Performance Prediction: End-to-End Modular ML Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Machine Learning solution designed to predict student math scores based on demographic and academic features. It is built using a **modular software engineering approach**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and production-readiness.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.8+
* **Framework:** Flask (Web Interface)
* **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Dill
* **Architecture:** Modular Coding (Components & Pipelines)

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The project follows an industry-standard directory structure:
* `src/components`: Handles Data Ingestion, Transformation, and Model Training.
* `src/pipeline`: Contains Training and Prediction pipelines.
* `artifacts/`: Stores the trained model (`model.pkl`) and preprocessor object.
* `logs/`: Tracks every execution step for debugging.
* `templates/`: HTML files for the web interface.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Data Pipeline:** From raw CSV to trained model with a single command.
- **Custom Logging & Exception Handling:** Robust error tracking for production stability.
- **Predictive Web Interface:** A user-friendly Flask app to input data and receive real-time predictions.
